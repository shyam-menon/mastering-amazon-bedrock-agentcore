    "✅ **Completed in this notebook:**\n",
    "- AgentCore Runtime configuration and setup\n",
    "- Basic travel agent with Strands and Bedrock\n",
    "- Multi-turn conversation capabilities\n",
    "- Local agent testing and validation\n",
    "- Runtime deployment (AWS) or local development setup\n",
    "\n",
    "🎯 **Key Learning Outcomes:**\n",
    "- Created a functional AI travel agent using Strands framework\n",
    "- Implemented custom tools for budget calculation and destination info\n",
    "- Tested conversational flow with multiple interaction patterns\n",
    "- Learned AgentCore deployment process and alternatives\n",
    "\n",
    "➡️ **Next: Notebook 03 - Gateway Integration**\n",
    "- Integrate external APIs (flights, hotels, weather, currency)\n",
    "- Create OpenAPI 3.0 specifications\n",
    "- Set up MCP Gateway with OAuth\n",
    "- Test real API integrations with live data\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Note:** Your agent is fully functional whether deployed to AWS or running locally. The next notebook will enhance it with real-world API integrations!"
